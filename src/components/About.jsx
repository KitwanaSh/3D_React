      The traditional educational system is outdated and doesn't prepare students for the real world. It's too focused on memorizing
      facts and figures, but not enough on critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
      I want to create an educational system that is more relevant to the needs of the 21st century workforce. I want to create a system
      that teaches students how to think critically, solve problems, and be creative.
